# PLSQL - Programming Language SQL

## What is this Repo ?
Just like the other few repos on Javascript, Kotlin and Java, this repo is an organized dump of my codes in PL/SQL.

## Why maintain this repo ?
This repo is like a reference book for me. I have organized all class files according to the order in which I learn the topics.

## Basic Structure of a PL/SQL program
```sql 
DECLARE --optional
    <declarations>

BEGIN   --mandatory
    <executable statements. At least one executable statement is mandatory>

EXCEPTION --optional 
    <exception handles>

END;   --mandatory
/
```
